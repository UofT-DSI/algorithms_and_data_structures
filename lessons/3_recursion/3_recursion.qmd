# Call Stack

## How a Call Stack Works

-   Your computer internally uses a call stack (stack ADT) to execute functions

-   When you run your Python file, the `main` functions is called. `main` is pushed onto the stack

    -   Sounds familiar? `if __name__ == "__main__":`

-   As the main function executes, it may call other functions, each functions is pushed to the top of the stack

    -   The currently executing function is at the top of the stack

-   When each function is executed, it is popped from the stack

-   The function may return a value, which is passes to the calling function (the function below in the stack).

-   The calling function can use the return value and continue execution until the stack is empty

## Basic Example

-   If I run `round(float("20.24"))`, I expect `20`

    -   The `round` function is first to be called, it is pushed on the call stack

    -   Then, `float("20.24")` is called and pushed on the call stack

-   Now, we pop each function off the call stack.

    -   `float("20.24")` returns `20.24`

    -   `round` uses the return value of the previous function, `20.24`. It executes `round(20.24)`, which returns `20`

    -   The stack is empty, so the program finishes

# Recursion

## Motivating Example

-   Suppose you are looking for a key in a box, but the box contains more boxes!

![](images/box-recursion.png){fig-align="center" width="7.9cm"}

-   2 minutes: write down the steps of the algorithm you would take to search for the key

## Algorithm 1: Loop

1.  Make a pile of all the boxes

2.  Grab a box and open it

3.  If it contains a box, append it to your pile of boxes

4.  If it contains the key, you're done!

5.  Repeat

## Algorithm 2: Recursion

1.  Grab a box and open it

2.  If it contains a box, repeat step 1

3.  If it contains the key, you're done!

*Which algorithm do you like more?*

-   Notice the function is recursive because it calls itself

-   Both algorithms achieve the same thing, but recursion is clearer (to me)

## Formula to write a recursive function

-   Since recursive functions call themselves, its easy to write an infinite loop

-   Let's write a function that does a countdown

```{python}
def countdown(i):
  print(i)
  countdown(i - 1)
```

-   This runs forever, so we need a *base case* to tell the code when to stop

```{python}
def countdown(i):
  print(i)
  if i <= 0:
    return 
  else:
    countdown(i - 1)
```

## Factorial

-   The *factorial* is the product of all positive integers less than or equal to the given integer

    -   $5! = 5 \times 4 \times 3 \times 2 \times 1 = 120$

    -   We define $1! = 1$

-   Let's use recursion to calculate factorials

```{python}
def factorial(n):
  if x == 1:
    return 1
  else:
    return x * factorial(x - 1)
```

-   Let's examine the call stack when we call `factorial(3)`

## Multiple Recursive Calls: Fibonacci Sequence

-   In calculating the factorial, each recursion only calls itself once. This doesn't have to be the case

-   The Fibonacci Sequence is a sequence of numbers where the first two numbers are 0 and 1, with each subsequent number being being the sum of the previous two numbers in the sequence.

    -   Notice how the problem is defined recursively

```{python}
def fib(n):
  if n <= 1:
    return n
  else:
    return fib(n - 1) + fib(n - 2)
```

2 minutes: what is its time and space complexity?

# Time and Space Complexity of Recursion

## Time Complexity of Recursion

-   Generally, recursion doesn't have performance benefits compared to loops (in problems like finding a key in nested boxes)

    -   However, it is simpler to understand

-   The time complexity of recursion depends on the number of time the function calls itself (branches)

    -   Factorial: the `fact` is called $n$ times before reaching the base case so its $O(1^n) = O(n)$

    -   If a recursive function called itself twice, then its $(2^n)$

-   When a recursive function makes multiple calls, the run time will often be $O(branches^{depth})$

## Tricky Example

```{python}
#| eval: false
def recursive(n):
  for i in range(n):
    # Something happens
    i += 2
  if n <= 0:
    return 1
  else:
    return 1 + recursive(n - 3)
```

-   Loop takes $n/2$ steps, because we increase `i` by 2

-   Recursion takes $n/3$ steps **and** the loop is called recursively.

    -   In other words, for each recursion, run the loop.

-   The time complexity is $n/2 \times n/3 = \frac{n^2}{6} = O(n^2)$

## Space complexity of recursion

-   Notice the call stack takes up space in memory. How much depends on the depth of the recursion

-   Think about the maximum amount of space the call stack will need

    -   Factorial: $O(n)$, when recursion reaches the base case

-   Even when you have multiple branches, it's possible only 1 branch at depth $n$ is in memory at a time

-   2 minutes: to find the key in nested boxes, what is the memory complexity of the recursive approach versus the loop approach?

# Mergesort

## Divide and Conquer Algorithms

-   Divide and Conquer (D&C) is a general method to solve problems utilizing recursion.

    -   Figure out the simplest case and use it as the base case

    -   Figure out how to reduce your problem to the base case

-   Let's start with a trivial example: how would you sum a list of integers?

    -   Solution is obvious with a loop

    -   Let's do it recursively

## Divide and Conquer Algorithms

Step 1

-   What is the simplest array to sum?

-   Arrays with no elements or 1 element

    -   sum of `[]` is 0, sum of `[8]` is 8

Step 2

-   How can we reduce all arrays to empty array?

-   Notice `sum[2, 4, 5]` = 2 + `sum[4, 5]`, but the second version reduced the problem

## Divide and Conquer Algorithms

```{python}
def rec_sum(lst):
  if not lst:
    return 0
  else:
    return lst[0] + rec_sum(lst[1:])
```

-   Let's work on a real problem next!

## Mergesort

::: columns
::: {.column width="50%"}
-   Some lists don't need to be sorted

    -   Lists of size 1! This is our base case

-   We can split lists in half until they contain 1 element, then merge all of the sub-lists

-   Python's sort function uses a hybrid of merge and insertion sort, both of which you've learned!

## Big-O of Merge Sort

First consider the non-recursive part of the code

-   The "divide" step takes linear time, since slicing operations take roughly $n/2$ steps to make a left and right copy respectively.

-   The merge operation also takes $n$ steps approximately

-   All other operations are constants

-   Together, the non-recursive part of this algorithm is $O(n)$

Next consider the recursive calls

-   Recall the big-O of recursion depends on the recursion depth and number of calls. $O(branches^{depth})$

-   The depth in Merge Sort is the number of times you need to divide to get to a list of length 1.

-   Mathematically, $2^{\text{depth}} = n$, then $\text{depth} = \text{log}n$. So there are approximately log $n$ levels

## Big-O of Mergesort

-   Since the $O(n)$ steps must be performed each recursion, the total run time is $O(n\text{log}n)$. Our analysis only depended on the size of the list, so the best and worst case of mergesort is the same

-   This is much faster than insertion sort!

-   2 minutes: does it have less space complexity than insertion sort?
