# Setting up an Optimization Problem

## Types of Optimization Problems

-   *Optimization* refers to maximizing or minimizing a function with respect to its inputs

-   Continuous optimization is when all the variables in the problem are continuous

-   Discrete optimization occurs when some or all of the variables in the problem are discrete

    -   Continuous: how many hours should workers in a factory work to maximize profits?

    -   Discrete: how do I allocate TAs to teach within a department?

## Autocorrect Example

-   Autocorrect in an optimization algorithm. It has two parts

    -   We need a list of known words and their use frequency

    -   Classify errors are either: add a letter, remove a letter, substitute a letter, or switched two adjacent letters

-   We quantify the error distance as the of errors in a string.

    -   "ovon" -\> "oven" is error distance 1

    -   "ovvvn" -\> "ovven" -\> "oven" is error distance 2

## Autocorrect Example

1.  Check whether a word is in the dictionary

2.  If the word is not in the dictionary, generate words that are error distance 1 or 2 from the given word

3.  Rank the most likely correction given the error distance and use frequency

-   "thene" could be "then" or "the," but but "the" is more common

## Autocorrect Example

What are the steps to model the problem?

-   We have the specification of possible inputs

    -   Text, discrete

-   The *objective function* is the function you are trying to maximize more minimize

    -   Function with 2 variables: error distance and frequency

-   Are we maximizing or minimizing the objective function

    -   Minimize error distance and maximize frequency

-   Identify the *constraints* in the problem

    -   Only looking for words in the dictionary, only looking for words with error distance 1 or 2

## Shortest Path in a Graph Example

-   Finding the shortest path between two nodes on a graph is a discrete optimization problem

-   The range of inputs are all possible paths from A to B

-   The objective function is the length of the path

-   We are minimizing the objective function

-   And there are no constraints

## Brute Force

Consider the following problems and proposed solutions

-   You want to consume all necessary nutrients and calories at the lowest cost. So, you find all valid combinations of foods and find their cost.

    -   If there are 10 foods, and 15 nutritional categories, then there are $2^{10 \times 15} = 1.42 \times 10^{45}$ combinations to evaluate

    -   We will fix this with *linear programming*

-   You are robbing a store but the escape vent can only carry 4 kg of goods. To steal the maximum money's worth of goods, you calculate every set of goods and find the one giving the most value

    -   If there are 3 goods in the store, then there are 8 combinations. But with 4 goods, there are 16 combinations. This solution is $O(2^n)$ time.

    -   We will fix this with *dynamic programming*

# Linear Programming

## Linear Programming

-   Linear programming (LP) takes advantage of a program being linear. (what does that mean?)

-   If we're considering a food that already fills one nutrition category, we can eliminate all other combinations that use the food

    -   Sounds obvious, but brute forcing doesn't consider this!

-   By this process of elimination, we make the problem much faster to solve.

## Implementing LP in Python

Let's consider a very simple diet problem where the goal is to minimize the cost. There are 3 foods: apples (\$3), bananas (\$1), and oranges (\$3). We want to meet 3 constraints: of vitamin A, a number of vitamin B, and a number of calories.

-   Assume there is no upper limit on calories or vitamins

-   The PuLP library is a popular linear programming library to do this in Python

```{python}
from pulp import LpProblem, LpMinimize, LpVariable, lpSum
```

## Implementing LP in Python

```{python}
#| output: false
diet_problem = LpProblem("Diet_Problem", LpMinimize)

# Define output variables
x1 = LpVariable("Apples", lowBound=0)
x2 = LpVariable("Bananas", lowBound=0)
x3 = LpVariable("Oranges", lowBound=0)

# Define objective function (minimize cost)
diet_problem += 3 * x1 + x2 + 3 * x3, "Total_Cost"

# Define nutritional constraints
diet_problem += 50 * x1 + 120 * x2 + 60 * x3 >= 2000, "Calories"
diet_problem += 2 * x1 + 3 * x2 + 5 * x3>= 40, "Vitamin A"
diet_problem += 12 * x1 + x2 + 2 * x3>= 50, "Vitamin B"

diet_problem.solve()
```

## Implementing LP in Python

```{python}
print("Optimal Diet:")
print(f"Apples: {round(x1.value(), 2)} units")
print(f"Bananas: {round(x2.value(), 2)} units")
print(f"Oranges: {round(x3.value(), 2)} units")
print(f"Total Cost: {round(diet_problem.objective.value(), 2)}")
```

# Dynamic Programming

## Problem

The escape vent can carry only 4 kg of goods. The items are:

-   Stereo: \$3000, 4 kg

-   Laptop: \$2000, 3 kg

-   Guitar: \$1500, 1 kg

We've established the brute force is not a valid general solution (although feasible in this case)

-   The idea behind dynamic programming is that we'll solve subproblems that will lead to a solution to the big problem. We can pack items starting by considering smaller, sub backpacks

## Guitar Row

::: columns
::: {.column width="50%"}
-   Each dynamic programming problem starts with a grid

-   Each cell contains a list of items that can fit at that point

-   For cell Guitar 1, a guitar will fit there. It will also fit in cell Guitar 2, 3, 4

-   Sounds redundant, but let's keep going
:::

::: {.column width="50%"}
![](images/dynamic.png)
:::
:::

## Stereo Row

::: columns
::: {.column width="50%"}
-   In the second row, we can steal the stereo or the guitar.

-   At 1 kg, you can only steal the guitar, same as for every other cell until Stereo 4, at which point you can steal the stereo and only the stereo.
:::

::: {.column width="50%"}
![](images/dynamic.png)
:::
:::

## Laptop Row

::: columns
::: {.column width="50%"}
-   Now we can steal all 3 items

-   In the first two columns, we still can only steal the guitar. But in Laptop 3, we can steal the laptop

-   Laptop 4 is the interesting step. We could steal only the stereo, or the laptop and something else for 1 kg. What is that 1 kg item?

-   According to the above row, the max value for 1 kg is the guitar!
:::

::: {.column width="50%"}
![](images/dynamic.png)
:::
:::

## Solution

::: columns
::: {.column width="50%"}
-   If we stole the guitar and laptop, the total value is 3500, which is greater than just stealing the stereo

-   Thus, we should steal guitar and laptop

## Formula for each cell

-   We skipped some very trivial steps in calculating cells aside from the last one

-   Here's the explicit formula to calculate each cell's value

Let $i$ be the row and $j$ be the column.

$$
\text{cell}[i][j] = \max
    \begin{cases}
        \text{the previous max at cell}[i-1][j]\\
        \text{value of current item + value of remaining space}
    \end{cases}
$$

The value of remaining space is cell\[i-1\]\[j-item's weight\]

## Python Implementation

```{python}
def initialize_table(rows, cols):
  return [[0] * cols for _ in range(rows)]
```

## Python Implementation

```{python}
def knapsack_dynamic_programming(values, weights, capacity):
  n = len(values)
  dp = initialize_table(n + 1, capacity + 1)

  # Fill the table using dynamic programming
  for i in range(1, n + 1):
    for w in range(capacity + 1):
      # Include the current item if it fits in the knapsack
      if weights[i - 1] <= w:
        dp[i][w] = max(dp[i - 1][w], \
        values[i - 1] + dp[i - 1][w - weights[i - 1]])
      else:
        dp[i][w] = dp[i - 1][w]

  selected_items = traceback(dp, values, weights, capacity)

  return dp[n][capacity], selected_items
```

## Python Implementation

```{python}
def traceback(dp, values, weights, capacity):
  selected_items = []
  i, w = len(dp) - 1, capacity

  while i > 0 and w > 0:
    if dp[i][w] != dp[i - 1][w]:
      selected_items.append(i - 1)
      w -= weights[i - 1]
      i -= 1

  selected_items.reverse()
  return selected_items
```

## Python Implementation

```{python}
values = [3000, 2000, 1500]
weights = [4, 3, 1]
capacity = 4

max_value, selected_items = \
knapsack_dynamic_programming(values, weights, capacity)

print("Maximum value:", max_value)
print("Selected items:", selected_items)
```

## Live Coding

Let a substring be *upper-lower* if for every letter of the alphabet that the string contains, it appears both in uppercase and lowercase. For example, `aaA` is upper-lower because it has both "A" and "a." `aAbb` is not upper-lower because it lacks an upper case "B."

Given string, return the longest substring that is *upper-lower.*

### Example

```{python}
#| eval: false
# INPUT
string = "AqeQEfa"
# OUTPUT
"qeQE"
```
