    "\n",
    "CONCEPT:\n",
    "Instead of using extra space with a set, we can use a nested loop approach \n",
    "that uses O(1) space but takes O(n²) time.\n",
    "\n",
    "ALGORITHM THINKING:\n",
    "1. Use two nested loops with indices i and j\n",
    "2. The outer loop (i) iterates through each element from index 0 to n-1\n",
    "3. For each element at position i, the inner loop (j) starts from i+1 and \n",
    "   checks all subsequent elements\n",
    "4. If we find nums[i] == nums[j], we've found our first duplicate\n",
    "5. Return nums[i] immediately\n",
    "6. If both loops complete without finding a match, return -1\n",
    "\n",
    "EXAMPLE WALKTHROUGH: [4, 5, 6, 4, 6]\n",
    "- i=0 (num=4): Check against [5,6,4,6] → Found match at j=3! Return 4\n",
    "- We don't need to check i=1,2,... because we already found the answer\n",
    "\n",
    "WHY SOMEONE MIGHT USE THIS:\n",
    "- When the input list is guaranteed to be very small (n < 100)\n",
    "- When you cannot use additional data structures\n",
