    "An alternative solution would be to use a bubble sort-like approach to achieve an $O(n^2)$ time complexity and an $O(n)$ space complexity. More explcitly, one could use two nested loops. The outer loop traverses each position in the list. The inner loop traverses from the beginning to the end, reduced by the number of iterations that the outer loop has completed + 1. If it encounters a zero followed immediately by a non-zero, it swaps those two elements. In that way, it \"bubbles\" zeros to the end. Each iteration of the outer loop results in a single additional zero positioned at the end, up to the number of zeros in the list. This solution has $O(n)$ space complexity since an $n$ element input list consumes $O(n)$ space. Although this alternative does not reduce the space complexity compared to my solution, it does obviate the need for the additional data structure (the `deque`)."
