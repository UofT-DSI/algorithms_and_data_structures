    "In Assignment 1, I worked on solving the problem of moving all zeros in a list to the end while maintaining the relative order of non-zero elements. My approach focused on iterating through the list, separating zeros and non zeros, and reconstructing the list accordingly. During the review session with my partner, I reviewed their solution, which was similar in structure but included a call to .sort() on the non-zero elements.\n",

While the code functionally moved the zeros to the end, I noticed that using .sort() changed the original order of the non-zero elements, which destroyed one of the key constraints of the task. Discussing this with my partner helped clarify the importance of fully understanding the problem before implementing a solution.\n",
