    "In Assignment 1, my process started with making sure I fully understood the problem statement and constraints before writing any code. I learned that small details (like “first duplicate encountered” or “maintain relative order”) change the best data structure choice. I planned the solution by identifying the simplest abstract data type for the task (for example, a set for duplicates, a stack for bracket matching, or two pointers for in-place rearrangement). After implementing, I tested using both the provided examples and a few edge cases (empty input, no duplicates, single element, repeated values early). Writing the explanation helped me confirm correctness and identify any missing corner cases.\n",

    "For the partner review, I focused on reading their code as if I were maintaining it: checking clarity, correctness, and whether the time/space complexity matched what the problem demanded. Tracing one of their examples step-by-step was especially helpful because it revealed how the algorithm behaved in practice. The code review experience improved my ability to communicate feedback constructively—highlighting strengths first, then suggesting specific improvements like clearer variable naming, extra edge-case handling, and brief comments. Overall, these assignments strengthened both my problem-solving approach and my ability to evaluate code like in a real interview or team setting."
